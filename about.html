            <p> mission is to share and grow the world’s knowledge. Not all knowledge can be written down, but much of that which can be, still isn't. It remains in people’s heads or only accessible if you know the right people. We want to connect the people who have knowledge to the people who need it, to bring together people with different perspectives so they can understand each other better, and to empower everyone to share their knowledge for the benefit of the rest of the world.</p>

        <p>Gather around a question
The heart of Quora is questions — questions that affect the world, questions that explain recent world events, questions that guide important life decisions, and questions that provide insights into why other people think differently. Quora is a place where you can ask questions that matter to you and get answers from people who have been there and done that. Quora is where scientists, artists, entrepreneurs, mechanics, and homemakers take refuge from misinformation and incendiary arguments to share what they know</p>

Tell a story
Ever since the first humans gathered around a fire and turned their gaze to the stars, humanity has shared knowledge through stories. Spaces are digital campfires for collective meaning making which expand knowledge sharing from interrogative to narrative. In Spaces, creators build audiences of millions for their unique insights or audiences of thousands for niche knowledge that can't be found anywhere else.</p>

Understand the world and people in it
Great writers help you understand why the world works the way it does, why people behave the way they do, and what we can all do to make the world better. Millions of people search the web for answers and millions of people write answers on Quora, every week.
Quora’s answers come from people who really understand the issues and have first-hand knowledge.</p>
